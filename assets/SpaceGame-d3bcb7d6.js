It was a really exciting project for me because it was my second time working in VR and allowed me to explore creating a unique environment to match the unique locomotion of VR games. I had a lot of fun making the player float around and trying my hand at making a spooky environment. If I could get another stab at it or return to the project I’d like to implement a monster of some kind because as of now it’s completely empty and there’s no pay off for the spooky vibes.","title-delay":300,"desc-delay":600},null,8,["project-pictures"]))}},s=a(c,[["__scopeId","data-v-10c6770f"]]);export{s as default};
