I was the primary programmer. The team spent a lot of time discussing how the implementation of the monster should work, as the monster was the most important part of the game. It was decided that, to show off the animation capabilities of our artist, that the monster should be driven by root motion animation. I had to learn what root motion animation was as well as how to make it cooperate with Unity’s implementation of Nav Mesh. The solution I ended up using was allowing the navmesh agent attached to the monster to control the monster rotation while having the animator's root motion move it forward and back. This implementation still has some issues (the monster occasionally likes to walk right through walls for example) but given my time restraint and my knowledge at the time I’m still quite proud of it.",rows:3,"title-delay":300,"desc-delay":600,"links-delay":900,"img-delay":700,randomize:!1},null,8,["project-pictures","project-links"])]))}};export{m as default};
